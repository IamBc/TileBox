<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	I saw a few websites using grid layouts and I decided to make some of the desings. In the process of making them
I figured that I might as well put all the common CSS classes I use for every grid layout and create a small library 
that may be helpful to someone in some point in time.
 </p>
<br/><br/>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Title management</li>
<li>On hover effect management</li>
<li>Category management</li>
<li>Various common CSS solutions</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<h2>How to use (specificatons)</h2>
<p>
In the .css file you can find all the details you need to know about the classes, ect.<br/>
Here we are going to focus on the big picture.<br/></p>

<ul>
<li>You have your website flow. In it there is a div where the gridlayout will be.</li>
<li>You create the layout - size and position. There are plenty of example layouts I've made from which you can copy/get inspiration.</li>
<li>Style the grid layout using the css classes, or by modifying some of them and you are done.</li>
</ul>

<p> This is more or less the big picture, although there are some things that we should have a look at;
It is what a tile usually consists of. We will have a look if the tile conssists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Background image <br/> Basically what will be seen by the user</li>
<li>Onhover effect <br/> an effect which will usually be a single color, just to help you know what you are selecting</li>
<li>A title <br/> Basically what the user will read</li>
<li>A category <br/> A small part of the screen and can only hold a few words, so the category names must be really short.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the details on positioning, size and color manipulation can be found in the .css file.</p>
